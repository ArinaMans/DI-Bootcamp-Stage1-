        <li><h2>Cave's style is inimitable as it ranges across a spectrum that includes noisy, clattering,
          but extremely musical rock -- equal parts mutant rockabilly, garage, indie, post-punk and cabare.
          Since the late '70s, Australian singer and songwriter Nick Cave has proved to be one of the most enduring talents
         to emerge from the post-punk era.</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Cave's musical work was featured in different popular shows, such as the Netflix series After Life, 
          BBC series Peaky Blinders and the Australian series Jack Irish. 
          "Red Right Hand" is the theme song for Peaky Blinders and renditions of the track can be heard throughout the series.</h2></li>
        <li><h2>Cave released his first book, King Ink, in 1988. It is a collection of lyrics and plays,
          including collaborations with Lydia Lunch. This was followed up with King Ink II in 1997, 
          containing lyrics, poems, and the transcript of a radio essay he wrote for the BBC in July 1996, 
          "The Flesh Made Word", discussing in biographical format his relationship with Christianity.</h2></li>
